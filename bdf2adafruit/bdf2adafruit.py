# Based on version from William Skellenger:
#
# This small script is designed to mostly take a BDF file and convert it to a
# format that can largely be cut/pasted as an Adafruit-format font.
# It was written in an hour or so and did what I needed it to do.
# I used it for one file. Maybe it bombs on other files.

#
# Modifications:
#
# Script modified as it did not work with the outputed BDF files I got out of
# "gbdfed" http://sofia.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/gbdfed/. 
#
# - It assumes a fix max width of 16. Zero fills right
# - Does not require that all glyphs are defined
# - Uses FONT name defined in BDF
# - Outputs working .h file
# - Added extended comments (ASCII character)
# - Assumes glyphs 0 to 127 only
